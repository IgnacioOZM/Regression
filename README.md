# Regression
This GitHub repository will track all of my projects regarding regression for my machine learning course. 
Regression analysis is a fundamental concept in the field of machine learning. It falls under supervised
learning wherein the algorithm is trained with both input features and output labels. It helps in establishing
a relationship among the variables by estimating how one variable affects the other. 

In this course I will focus on the regression of structured data with the implementation of multiple algorithms:

* Linear regression
* Regularization
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)
